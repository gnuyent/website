# About

Hey! I'm Brandon. I'm a full stack engineer at [Intuit](https://www.intuit.com/) where I work on building and improving content pipelines and creating responsive front-end widgets.

I recently (2022) graduated from [San Diego State University](https://www.sdsu.edu) with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. While there, and in high school, I competed in different security competitions.

My main hobbies are:

-   [Climbing](/blog/climbing-stats)
-   Coffee
-   Reading
-   Board games
-   Cool tech

<br />

some of which I'll probably write on!

## Technology

This site is built using [Astro](https://astro.build/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). I host it on GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions and build directly from the `main` branch.

You can find the source on [GitHub](https://github.com/gnuyent/website).

The sans font is [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/), the serif font is [STIX Two](https://www.stixfonts.org/).
