# About

Hey! I'm Brandon. This blog is a place to experiment and share my thoughts. I'm
a full stack software engineer in San Diego, CA.

<br />

I'm currently at Intuit, working on building and improving content pipelines and creating responsive front-end widgets.

<br />

Here's some things that I like:

- [Climbing](/blog/climbing-stats)
- Coffee
- Reading
- Cool tech

## Technology

This site is built using [Astro](https://astro.build/) with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) components and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) integrations. It's hosted on GitHub Pages with automatic CI/CD with GitHub Actions from the `main` branch.

<br />

If you are interested in the source code, you can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/gnuyent/website).

<br />

The sans font is [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/). The serif font is [STIX Two](https://www.stixfonts.org/).
