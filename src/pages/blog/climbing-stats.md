## Outdoors

None yet!

# Gear Thoughts

## Chalk

So far, I have used:

- Frank Endo Block Gym Chalk
- 8BPlus Powder Chalk
- Metolius Chalk Sock

I have not noticed a difference between any of these chalks. Buy whatever is cheapest!

## Shoes

Only have used the Tarantulas. These stretched a lot, recommend sizing down.

## Misc

I use a carabiner to keep my shoes and chalk bucket together.
