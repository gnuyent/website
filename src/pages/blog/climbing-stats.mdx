# Gear Thoughts

## Chalk

So far, I have used:

-   Frank Endo Block Gym Chalk
-   8BPlus Powder Chalk
-   Metolius Chalk Sock

I have not noticed a difference between any of these chalks. Buy whatever is cheapest!

## Shoes

I have a slight case of [Morton's toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morton's_toe) (+1 mm) with regular foot width.

So far I've only used the [La Sportiva Tarantulas](https://www.lasportivausa.com/tarantula.html). I bought them a full size smaller than my street shoe but they still felt too big after ~2 months of regular usage. The toe box feels nice and roomy although my second toe blistered on the top knuckle while it was still stretching.

For reference, I wear a 44.5 EU (11.5 US) street shoe and purchased 43.5 EU. I think a 42.5 or 43 would have been perfect.

## Misc

I use a carabiner to keep my shoes and chalk bucket together.
